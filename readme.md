# First step you must install REST api on Backend.
> A Laravel project
## Build Setup REST api on Backend

``` bash
# clone project from my repository to your folder with working domain
    git clone https://github.com/KostiantynLogunov/app1-RESTful-api.git

# next step
    composer install

# then make a file .env with settings. For Example I left file .env.example. Pay attantion to DB settings!

# then if you have good .env with correct settings, create basic tables in you DataBase
    php artisan migrate
    
# generate key for app
    php artisan key:generate

# For work of front app client and rest api I used JWT. Generate a new secret of jwt:
    php artisan jwt:secret
    
# Clear cache
    php artisan config:clear
    php artisan cache:clear
    
# If you don't have a workin domain for backend app you can launch backend app in such a way:
  
    php artisan serve
        or
    php artisan serve --port=9000
        --port=9000 - for set server port
  
  but then dont forget set correct domain in config.js of Frontend app. 
  
# For unittest
    phpunit
        # I made 11 tests. All tests are successfuly. I run tests in Homestead environment on vagrant.
```

# Second step install project Client with VueJS

go to Client app's repository [Frontend application](https://github.com/KostiantynLogunov/app2-Client-SPA).
> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# clone project from my repository
    git clone https://github.com/KostiantynLogunov/app2-Client-SPA.git

# After cloning go to /src/helpers/config.js and set domain where wil be REST api on Backend. Set domain in file config.js, key - apiUrl. You have to set domain like example "http://domain.com/api". "/api" is required!

# next install dependencies
    npm install

# build for production with minification
    npm run build

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
    npm run dev
```
## System is ready to work !

## For start You must register a new user and than work with client and contacts. You may it in Frontend app client.
